# RPI Robot

This repo contains some files that can be used in the robotic learning with an RPi2

Every file contains self-explaining comments of the beahavior.

## What do I need to create the robot?

- Raspberry Pi 2 - You can use any other version, but I am  using the proper GPIO ports for this version
- Robot Car Chassis Kit - I have seen a lot of this type in the net at low price. Ensure it includes 4 motors and the 4 wheels. Batteries box is a plus.
- L298N Dual H Bridge - This is where you have to connect motors, RPi and batteries.
- WiFi Dongle for RPi.
- Jumpers
- Breadboard
